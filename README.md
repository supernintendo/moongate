A framework for multiplayer game servers written in Elixir.

### Overview ###

This project is intended to be a platform for building multiplayer game servers. Moongate contains an Elixir DSL for managing game state and communicating with clients. It aims to provide a simple backbone for your serverside code:

- *Pools* - Pools contain the objects that make up your game world. Members of a pool have attributes that can be mutated over time (for example, a `Character`'s movement).
- *Stages* - Stages are essentially a collection of pools. Game clients can join stages, allowing them to send messages to the pools within as well as synchronize with their state.

Moongate supports TCP, UDP and WebSockets. It includes a JavaScript library `moongate.js` for web based games.

### Status ###

Moongate is **not production ready**. At this time, future versions are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible.

### Dependencies ###

* Elixir 1.0.5+
* PostgreSQL 9.3.5+

### Setup ###
The easiest way to get Moongate up and running is by executing the setup script using `./scripts/setup.sh`. This script creates a database, fetches dependencies and runs Ecto migrations. Once this is done, start the server with `./moongate.sh` (or `iex -S mix` if you need a REPL). The `default` project runs on [localhost:2594](http://localhost:2594).
